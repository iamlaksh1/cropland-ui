<h3>Cropland CROS Proof of concept</h3>
<h4>https://croplandcros.scinet.usda.govüåç </h4>

‚ùì This repository hosts my full-stack project, Cropland CROS POC. The aim of this project is to explore whether we can develop and deploy the Cropland CROS site in-house using available open data, rather than relying on USDA resources.

<h1>Info</h1>

<h2>Technologies used üîß</h2>

All the code in frontend and backend are made with TypeScript, Python and GDAL and with latest libraries and standards.

<h3>Frontend</h3>
    
  -   Frontend powered by React, Vite, and  Material UI for components.
  -   Routing by React Router, state management by Tanstack Query (React Query). 
  -   Map powered by Mapbox.

<h3>Backend</h3>

-   Backend powered by Python using FastAPI and pixi framework. Here is the API [document](https://iamlaksh1.github.io/site/an-api-with-geospatial-capabilities-using-pixi/) 
-   GDAL used for raster manipulation

<h2>Basic features ‚≠ê</h2>

- Create a simple UI that allows users to draw a polygon on a map and calculate cropland statistics for the polygon.

  - The backend API currently takes only the 2022.tif file for calculations, but the year can be adjusted using a slider on the front end.

  - Display the JSON response in a draggable data table. The results will filter crop with 0 acres 

  - In the area of interest, provide a list of U.S. states and display counties for the selected state.

  - For a chosen state or county, fetch the shape (GeoJSON) from tigerweb.geo.census.gov and show a notification for success or failure.

  - Note that the button in the area of interest is non-functional at the moment. In the future, it will call the backend API to retrieve county/state GeoJSON and compute crop statistics.

  - A custom hook (useHook) has been created for data fetching

<h2>Set up for Front-end APPüîß</h2>

Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.  

Installation:

`npm install`  

To Start Server:
